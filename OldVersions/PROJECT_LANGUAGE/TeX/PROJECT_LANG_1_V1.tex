% About:
% I decided to make TeX the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-TeX) as TeX is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the TeX programming language. It only makes sense to TeX the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
